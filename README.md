Implement quicksort
The quickSort function should recursively sort the subarray array[p..r].
- If the subarray has size 0 or 1, then it's already sorted, and so nothing needs to be done.
- Otherwise, quickSort uses divide-and-conquer to sort the subarray.

The divide step should partition the array, the conquer step should recursively quicksort the partitioned subarrays, and the combine step should do nothing.

Once implemented, uncomment the Program.assertEqual() at the bottom to verify that the test assertion passes.
